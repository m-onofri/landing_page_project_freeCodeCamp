# Product Landing Page

Here I created a landing page for a fictional bike shop.
This project is from the freeCodeCamp course and it's based on HTML, CSS and javaScript.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/landing_page_project_freeCodeCamp.git
```

Go inside the **landing_page_project_freeCodeCamp** folder and open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser.


## ...or watch it live!

You can have a look at this app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/landing_page_project_freeCodeCamp/).


## Main features

* This is a fully responsive single page app.
* The app embed a video from Youtube.
* Customers' opinions are displayed using a carousel created with Vanilla javaScript.
* The logo is created from a bike icon that I get from [Freepick](www.flaticon.com)
* The images are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
